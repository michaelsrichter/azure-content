# Connect your app to your VNET with PowerShell #

## Overview ##

In the Azure App Service you can connect your app (web, mobile or API) to a VNET in your subscription.  This feature is called VNET Integration.  The VNET Integration feature should not be confused with the App Service Environment feature which allows you to run an instance of the Azure App Service in your VNET. 

The VNET Integration has UI in the new portal and lets you integrate with V1 or V2 VNETs.  If you want to learn more about the feature then go here: Integrate your app with an Azure Virtual Network.

This write up is not about using the UI but rather on how to enable integration using PowerShell.  The commands for V1 VNETs are different than for V2 VNETs so there are two sections.  

Before going through this document, ensure that you have:

1. The latest Azure PowerShell SDK installed. You can install this with the Web Platform Installer
1. An App in the Azure App Service running in a Standard or Premium SKU

## V1(Classic) VNETS ##

This document covers three items for V1 VNETs

- connecting your app to a pre-existing V1 VNET that has a gateway and is configured for point-to-site
- updating your VNET integration information for your app
- disconnecting your app from your V1 VNET

### Connecting an app to a V1(Classic) VNET ###

Connecting an app to a Virtual Network (VNET) is a three step process:

1. Declare to the web app that it will be joining a particular VNET. The app will generate a certificate that will be given to the VNET for Point-to-Site connectivity
1. Upload the web app certificate to the VNET, and then retrieve the point-to-site VPN package URI
1. Update the web apps VNET connection with the point-to-site package URI

Steps 1) and 3) above are fully scriptable but step 2) requires a one-time manual action through the portal, or access to perform PUT or PATCH actions on the virtual network ARM endpoint (contact Azure Support to have this enabled).  Before you start make sure you have a classic virtual network with Point-to-Site already enabled, with a Gateway created/deployed.  To create the gateway and enable point-to-site you need to use the portal as described here [Creating a VPN Gateway][createvpngateway]

The V1 VNET needs to be in the same subscription as your App Service Plan that holds the app you are integrating with.

#####Setting up Azure PowerShell SDK#####

Open up a PowerShell window and set up your azure account and subscription using:

	Login-AzureRmAccount

That command will open a prompt to get your Azure credentials.  After signing in then use either

	Select-AzureRmSubscription –SubscriptionName [WebAppSubscriptionName]

or

	Select-AzureRmSubscription –SubscriptionId [WebAppSubscriptionId]

to select the subscription that you want to use.  Make sure that you are using the subscription that your VNET and App Service Plan are in.  

#####Variables used in this document#####

To simplify below commands, we will set a $Configuration PowerShell variable with the specific configuration.

Set a variable as follows in PowerShell with the following parameters:

	$Configuration = @{} 
	$Configuration.WebAppResourceGroup = "[Your web app resource group]"
	$Configuration.WebAppName = "[Your web app name]"
	$Configuration.VnetSubscriptionId = "[Your vnet subscription id]" 
	$Configuration.VnetResourceGroup = "[Your vnet resource group]" 
	$Configuration.VnetName = "[Your vnet name]"
 
The app location should be the location without any spaces, e.g. West US is westus

	$Configuration.WebAppLocation = "[Your web app Location]" 

The next item is where the certificate should be written.  It should be a writable path on your local system. Make sure to include .cer at the end. 

	$Configuration.GeneratedCertificatePath = "[C:\Path\To\Certificate.cer]" 

To see what you set, type $Configuration.

	> $Configuration
	
	Name                           Value
	----                           -----
	GeneratedCertificatePath       C:\vnetcert.cer
	VnetSubscriptionId             efc239a4-88f9-2c5e-a9a1-3034c21ad496
	WebAppResourceGroup            vnetdemo-rg
	VnetResourceGroup              testase1-rg
	VnetName                       TestNetwork
	WebAppName                     vnetintdemoapp
	WebAppLocation                 centralus

The rest of the document assumes that you have a variable created as just described.

#####Declare the VNET to the app#####

Use the following command to tell the app that it will be using this particular VNET. This will cause the app to generate necessary certificates:

	$vnet = New-AzureRmResource -Name "$($Configuration.WebAppName)/$($Configuration.VnetName)" -ResourceGroupName $Configuration.WebAppResourceGroup -ResourceType "Microsoft.Web/sites/virtualNetworkConnections" -PropertyObject @{"VnetResourceId" = "/subscriptions/$($Configuration.VnetSubscriptionId)/resourceGroups/$($Configuration.VnetResourceGroup)/providers/Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/virtualNetworks/$($Configuration.VnetName)"} -Location $Configuration.WebAppLocation -ApiVersion 2015-07-01

If this command succeeds, $vnet should have a variable Properties in it. The Properties variable should contain both a certificate thumbprint as well as the certificate data.

#####Uploading Web App Certificate to Virtual Network#####

There is a manual one-time step required for each subscription and VNET combination. That is, if you are connecting apps in Subscription A to VNET A, you will need to only do this step once regardless of how many apps you configure. If you are adding a new app to another  VNET, this will need to be done again. The reason for this is that a set of certificates is generated at a subscription level in Azure App Service, and is generated once for each VNET that the apps will connect to. 

The certificates will have already been set if you followed these steps or if you integrated with the same VNET using the portal.

The first step is to generate the .cer file.  The second step is to upload the .cer file to your VNET. To generate the .cer file from the API call in the earlier step, run the following commands.

	$certBytes = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($vnet.Properties.certBlob)
	[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("$($Configuration.GeneratedCertificatePath)", $certBytes)

The certificate will be found in the location specified with $Configuration.GeneratedCertificatePath

To upload the certificate manually use the new portal at the [Azure Portal][azureportal] and Browse Virtual Network (classic) –> VPN connections –> Point-to-site –> Manage certificates.  From here upload your certificate.

#####Get the Point-To-Site Package#####

The next step in setting up a VNET connection on a Web App is to get the Point-To-Site package and provide it to your Web App.

Save the following template into a file called GetNetworkPackageUri.json somewhere on your computer, e.g. C:\Azure\Templates\GetNetworkPackageUri.json

	{ 
		"$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2014-04-01-preview/deploymentTemplate.json#", 
		"contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", 
		"parameters": { 
			"certData": { 
				"type": "string" 
			}, 
			"certThumbprint": { 
				"type": "string" 
			}, 
			"networkName": { 
				"type": "string" 
			} 
		}, 
		"variables": { 
			"legacyVnetName": "[concat('Group ', resourceGroup().name, ' ', parameters('networkName'))]" 
			}, 
			"resources": [ 
			], 
		"outputs" : { 
			"PackageUri" : 
			{ 
			"value" : "[listPackage(resourceId('Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/virtualNetworks/gateways/clientRootCertificates', parameters('networkName'), 'primary', parameters('certThumbprint')), '2014-06-01').packageUri]", "type" : "string" 
			} 
		} 
	} 


Set input Parameters:

	$parameters = @{"certData" = $vnet.Properties.certBlob ; 
	certThumbprint = $vnet.Properties.certThumbprint ; 
	"networkName" = $Configuration.VnetName } 

Call the script:

	$output = New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name unused -ResourceGroupName $Configuration.VnetResourceGroup -TemplateParameterObject $parameters -TemplateFile C:\PATH\TO\GetNetworkPackageUri.json 


The variable $output.Outputs.packageUri will now contain the package URI to be given to your Web App.

#####Upload the point-to-site package to your app#####

The final step is to provide the app with this package. Simply execute the next command:

	$vnet = New-AzureRmResource -Name "$($Configuration.WebAppName)/$($Configuration.VnetName)/primary" -ResourceGroupName $Configuration.WebAppResourceGroup -ResourceType "Microsoft.Web/sites/virtualNetworkConnections/gateways" -ApiVersion 2015-07-01 -PropertyObject @{"VnetName" = $Configuration.VnetName ; "VpnPackageUri" = $($output.Outputs.packageUri).Value } -Location $Configuration.WebAppLocation 

You may get a message asking you to confirm that you are overwriting an existing resource, make sure to allow it.

With this command succeeding, your app should now be connected to the VNET. You can ensure this by going onto your app console, and type the following:

	SET WEBSITE_

If there is an Environment Variable called WEBSITE_VNETNAME with a value matching the name of the target VNET, all configurations have succeeded.

###Updating V1(classic) VNET integration information###

Updating or re-syncing your information requires you to simply repeat the steps followed when creating the integration in the first place.  Those steps are:

1. define your Configuration information
1. declare the VNET to the app
1. get the point-to-site package
1. upload the point-to-site package to your app

###Disconnect your app from a V1(classic) VNET###

To disconnect you need the Configuration information that was set during VNET integration.  Using that information there is then one command needed to disconnect your app from your VNET.

	$vnet = Remove-AzureRmResource -Name "$($Configuration.WebAppName)/$($Configuration.VnetName)" -ResourceGroupName $Configuration.WebAppResourceGroup -ResourceType "Microsoft.Web/sites/virtualNetworkConnections" -ApiVersion 2015-07-01

## V2(Resource Manager) VNETS ##

The V2 or Resource Manager VNETs have ARM APIs and there are a few things that we can do that make it easier than for V1 VNETs.   We have a script provided that will let you:

- Create a V2 VNET and integrate your app with it
- Create a gateway, and configure point-to-site in a pre-existing V2 VNET and then integrate your app with it
- Integrate your app with a pre-existing V2 VNET that has a gateway and point-to-site enabled 
- Disconnect your app from your V2 VNET

###V2 VNET App Service integration script###

Copy the script below and save it off to a file.  If you don’t want to use the script as is you can feel free to learn from it to see how to set things up with a V2 VNET.

Save a copy of the script.  In this document it was called V2VnetAllinOne.ps1 but you can call it whatever you like.  There are no arguments for this script.  You simply run it.  The first thing the script will do is prompt you to sign in.  After you sign in the script gets details about your account and returns a list of subscriptions to choose.  Not counting the pop up that asks for your credentials, the initial script execution looks like this:

	PS C:\Users\ccompy\Documents\VNET> .\V2VnetAllInOne.ps1
	Please Login
	
	Environment           : AzureCloud
	Account               : ccompy@microsoft.com
	TenantId              : 722278f-fef1-499f-91ab-2323d011db47
	SubscriptionId        : af5358e1-acac-2c90-a9eb-722190abf47a
	CurrentStorageAccount :
	
	Choose a subscription
	
	1) Demo Subscription (af5358e1-acac-2c90-a9eb-722190abf47a)
	2) MS Test (a5350f55-dd5a-41ec-2ddb-ff7b911bb2ef)
	3) Purple Demo Subscription (2d4c99a4-57f9-4d5e-a0a1-0034c52db59d)

	Please enter the Resource Group of your App: hcdemo-rg
	Please enter the Name of your App: v2vnetpowershell
	What do you want to do?
	
	1) Add a NEW Virtual Network to an App
	2) Add an EXISTING Virtual Network to an App
	3) Remove a Virtual Network from an App

The rest of this document goes into each of those 3 options. 

###Create a V2(Resource Manager) VNET and integrate with it###

To create a new V2 VNET and integrate it with your app, select 1) Add a NEW Virtual Network to an App.  This will prompt you for the name of the VNET.  In my case below I gave the name v2pshell. 

The script gives the details about the VNET being created. If I want, I can change any of the values.
In this example execution I created a VNET with the following settings:

	Virtual Network Name:         v2pshell
	Resource Group Name:          hcdemo-rg
	Gateway Name:                 v2pshell-gateway
	Vnet IP name:                 v2pshell-ip
	Vnet IP config name:          v2pshell-ipconf
	Address Space:                10.0.0.0/8
	Gateway Address Space:        10.5.0.0/16
	Point-To-Site Address Space:  172.16.0.0/12
	
	Do you wish to change these settings?
	[Y] Yes  [N] No  [?] Help (default is "N"):

If you want to change any of the values type Y and make the desired changes.  When you are happy with the VNET settings then type N or simply hit return when prompted on changing the settings.  From there on until completion the script will tell you some of what it is doing up until it goes to create the VNET Gateway.  That step can take up to an hour.  There is no progress indicator while it is in this phase but it will let you know when the gateway has been created.

When the script completes it will say **Finished**.  At this point you will have a V2 VNET that is created with the name and settings that you selected and this new VNET will also be integrated with your app. 

###Integrate your app with a pre-existing V2 VNET###

When integrating with a pre-existing VNET, if you provide a V2 VNET that doesn’t have a gateway or point-to-site then the script will set that up.  If the VNET already has those things set up then it goes straight into the app integration.  To start this process simply select option 2) Add an EXISTING Virtual Network to an App. 

This option only works if you have a pre-existing V2 VNET that is in the same subscription as your app.   After selection option 2 you will be presented with a list of your V2 VNETs.   

	Select a VNET to integrate with
	
	1) v2demonetwork
	2) v2pshell
	3) v2vnetintdemo
	4) v2asenetwork
	5) v2pshell2
	
	Choose an option:
	5

Simply select the VNET you want to integrate with.  If you already have a gateway with point-to-site enabled then the script will simply integrate your app with your VNET.   If you do not have a gateway then you will need to specify the gateway subnet.  Your gateway subnet must be in your VNET address space and it cannot be in any other subnet.  So if you have a VNET without a gateway and run this step, things look like this:

	This Virtual Network has no gateway. I will need to create one.
	Your VNET is in the address space 172.16.0.0/16, with the following Subnets:
	default: 172.16.0.0/24
	Please choose a GatewaySubnet address space: 172.16.1.0/26

In this example I created a VNET gateway with the following settings:

	Virtual Network Name:         v2pshell2
	Resource Group Name:          vnetdemo-rg
	Gateway Name:                 v2pshell2-gateway
	Vnet IP name:                 v2pshell2-ip
	Vnet IP config name:          v2pshell2-ipconf
	Address Space:                172.16.0.0/16
	Gateway Address Space:        172.16.1.0/26
	Point-To-Site Address Space:  172.16.0.0/12
	
	Do you wish to change these settings?
	[Y] Yes  [N] No  [?] Help (default is "N"):
	Creating App assocation to VNET

If you want to change any of those settings you can do so otherwise hit return and it will go ahead and create your gateway and attach your app to your VNET.  The gateway creation time is still an hour though make sure you keep that in mind.  When everything is completed the script will say Finished. 

###Disconnect your app from a V2 VNET###

Disconnecting your app from your V2 VNET does not take down the gateway or disable point-to-site.  You could after all be using it for something else.  It also does not disconnect it from any other apps other than the one you provide.  To perform this action select 3) Remove a Virtual Network from an App.  When you do so you will see something like this:

	Currently connected to VNET v2pshell
	
	Confirm
	Are you sure you want to delete the following resource:
	/subscriptions/edcc99a4-b7f9-4b5e-a9a1-3034c51db496/resourceGroups/hcdemo-rg/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/v2vnetpowers
	hell/virtualNetworkConnections/v2pshell
	[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):

The script says delete but it is not deleting the VNET.  It’s just removing the integration.  After you confirm that this is what you want to do, the command is processed quite quickly and tells you True when it is done.
